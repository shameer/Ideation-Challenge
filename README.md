# Ideation Challenge Code Repository

The repository contains the code and the data related to the Ideation Challenge, which is a part of the [Inbix 2017: Indian Conference on Bioinformatics](http://bioclues.org/inbix17/). The competition aims to create a Machine Learning algorithm which can provide a better accuracy than the algorithms used by the server [here](http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3dswap-pred/) used for predicting the peptides eligible for 3d domain swapping of peptide sequence.

## Background behind the challenge

3D domain swapping is a mechanism by which two or more peptide chain combine together to form a dimer or an oligomer by exchanging an identical structural element. Many factors like low pH, temperature or certain solvents can lead to 3D domain swapping among peptide chains. 

The challenge aims to find an algorithm which can make use of biologically relevant features and report a higher accuracy than the approaches used for the 3dswapping server like SVM and Random Forests.
